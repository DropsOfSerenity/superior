				UPGRADE TODAY and see the Superior Bands difference. Available in any diameter and length. Call Superior Bands to experience a better Quick Connect Belt. Superior Bands Twisted O-rings are a better alternative to Polyurethane belts and Urethane belts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Superior Bands replace Polyurethane / Urethane belts and O-Rings. Breaking apart line shaft conveyors, 90 degree transfers, and pop up diverters are a thing of the past! Welding together Polycord is a waste of labor costs and more importantly down time in your facility.

				Superior Bands Hook and Loop technology installs quickly and rapidly resulting in no labor costs and no downtime. Our bands probably look familar as you might have seen Polyurethane twisted O-Rings with hooks and loops out there. Those are a band aid fix and do not last. How do we know? We created those belts, made the patent on them, and then stopped manufacturing them. Our Superior Bands are naturally made from textiles and have an elastic pulling power that lasts and lasts. Large facilities see an average of twelve to fourteen months with our bands. Our Superior Bands also pull faster, on average 25 feet per minute, meaning over the course of a year you will see more product move out your doors. Most importantly we provide free samples and engineering support. Call today and we will ship you free samples for your line shaft, roller-to-roller, 90 degree transfer, and pop up diverters.
